SECTION - 1 : FUNDAMENTALS OF PRICING

There are three fundamental drivers of pricing- compute, storage and outbound data transfer.
In most cases,there is no charge for inbound data transfer or for data transfer between other AWS services within the same AWS Region. 
There are some exceptions,so be sure to verify data transfer rates before you begin to use the AWS service.
Outbound data transfer is aggregated across servicesand then charged at the outbound data transfer rate. 
This charge appears on the monthly statement as AWS Data Transfer Out.

AWS offers a range of cloud computing services. For each service, you pay for exactly the amount of resources that you actually need. 
This utility-style pricing model includes:
•Pay for what you use
•Pay less when you reserve
•Pay less when you use more
•Pay even less as AWS grows 


Pay less when you reserve
nvest in Reserved Instances (RIs):
•Save up to 75 percent
Options:
•All Upfront Reserved Instance (AURI) →largest discount
•Partial Upfront Reserved Instance (PURI) →lower discounts
•No Upfront Payments Reserved Instance (NURI) →smaller discount

Pay less when you use more
Savings as usage increases.
•Tiered pricing for services like Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS), or Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) 
→the more you use, the less you pay per GB.
•Multiple storage services deliver lowerstorage costs based on needs.
With AWS, you can get volume-based discounts and realize important savings as your usage increases. 
For services like Amazon Simple StorageService (Amazon S3), pricing is tiered, which means that you pay less per GB when you use more. 
In addition, data transfer in is always free. Multiple storage services deliver lower storage costs based on your needs.
As a result, as your AWS usage needs increase, you benefit from the economies of scale that enable you to increase adoption and keep costs under control.
As your organization evolves, AWS also gives you options to acquire services that help you address your business needs. 
For example, the AWS storage services portfolio offers options to help you lower pricing based on how frequently you access data and the performance that you need to retrieve it. 
To optimize your savings, you can choose the right combination of storage solutions that help you reduce costs while preserving performance, security, and durability.


 Pay even less as AWS grows
 As AWS grows:
 •AWS focuses on lowering cost of doing business.
 •This practice results in AWS passing savings from economies of scale to you.
 •Since 2006, AWS has lowered pricing 75times (as of September 2019).
 •Future higher-performing resources replace current resources for no extra charge.
