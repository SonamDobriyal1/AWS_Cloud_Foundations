Cloud Computing ‚Äì Detailed Notes (AWS Training: Module 1)
1. Definition of Cloud Computing
Cloud Computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources via the internet with a pay-as-you-go pricing model.

These resources include:

Compute power

Databases

Storage

Applications

Other IT services

These resources are run on servers located in data centers distributed around the world.

When using a cloud provider like AWS, the provider owns the infrastructure (hardware) you're using.

üîó More info: AWS Cloud Computing Overview

2. Concept: Infrastructure as Software
üõ†Ô∏è Traditional Infrastructure (Hardware-based)
Treated infrastructure as physical hardware

Requires:

Physical space in data centers

Staff to maintain it

Security for physical assets

Planning and capital investment

Problems:

Long procurement cycles for hardware

Need to guess and provision for peak usage

Over-provisioning = wasted cost

Under-provisioning = insufficient resources

Example: To launch a website, you must buy hardware, rack and stack it, install it in a data center, and maintain it.

üíª Cloud Infrastructure (Software-based)
Infrastructure is treated as software, not hardware.

Key Benefits:

Flexibility to choose the right service

Elastic scalability: Auto-scale up/down based on demand

On-demand provisioning: Spin up or terminate resources as needed

Cost-effective: Pay only for what you use

Speed: Launch new solutions quickly

Focus on innovation, not maintenance (no ‚Äúundifferentiated heavy lifting‚Äù)

3. Cloud Service Models
These represent different layers of abstraction and management responsibility:

Model	Description	User Responsibility	Example
IaaS
Infrastructure as a Service	Provides basic building blocks (VMs, storage, networking)	High ‚Äì full control over OS, apps, data	Amazon EC2
PaaS
Platform as a Service	Provides managed platform (runtime, OS, servers, storage)	Medium ‚Äì manage apps, not infra	AWS Elastic Beanstalk
SaaS
Software as a Service	Fully managed product used by end users	Low ‚Äì just use the app	Gmail, Dropbox

‚û°Ô∏è IaaS = Most control
‚û°Ô∏è SaaS = Least control, most abstraction

4. Cloud Deployment Models
These define where cloud resources are hosted:

Model	Description	Characteristics
Cloud	Entire application runs in the cloud	Created in or migrated to the cloud
Hybrid	Mix of on-premises + cloud resources	Allows gradual transition; links cloud to internal systems
On-Premises
(Private Cloud)	Resources run locally in your own data center	Offers dedicated resources, less flexibility

üîÑ Hybrid Example:
Company runs sensitive data workloads on-premises but offloads less sensitive operations (e.g., backups, web hosting) to AWS.

5. Summary of Benefits of Cloud Computing
Lower upfront costs

Faster deployment

Elastic scaling and auto-provisioning

Global reach

Improved resource utilization

Ability to experiment and innovate faster
