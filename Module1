# ☁️ Cloud Computing – AWS Training Module 1: Cloud Concepts Overview

## 📌 1. What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is the **on-demand delivery of compute power, storage, databases, applications**, and other IT resources through the internet with **pay-as-you-go** pricing.

- Resources run on servers in **worldwide data centers**.
- Cloud service providers like **AWS** own and manage these resources.

## 🖥️ 2. Infrastructure: Hardware vs. Software

### 🔧 Traditional Computing Model (Infrastructure as Hardware)

- Requires:
  - Physical space and data centers
  - Security and maintenance staff
  - Capital investment and procurement planning
- Challenges:
  - Long provisioning cycles
  - Guessing peak capacity needs
  - Under/over-provisioning leads to waste or shortages

💡 **Example**: To launch a website, you need to buy, install, and manage physical servers.

### 💻 Cloud Computing Model (Infrastructure as Software)

- Treats infrastructure as **software**, not physical hardware.
- Key Advantages:
  - Flexible and scalable
  - Provision/deprovision on demand
  - Automate scaling (elasticity)
  - Lower upfront costs
  - Eliminate maintenance work
  - Enables rapid experimentation and innovation

## 📦 3. Cloud Service Models

There are **three primary cloud service models**:

| Service Model | Description | User Responsibility | Example |
|---------------|-------------|----------------------|---------|
| **IaaS** (Infrastructure as a Service) | Provides virtualized compute, storage, and networking | Full control over OS, apps, storage, data | Amazon EC2 |
| **PaaS** (Platform as a Service) | Provides a platform for app deployment without managing infrastructure | Focus on app code and configuration | AWS Elastic Beanstalk |
| **SaaS** (Software as a Service) | Delivers fully functional applications managed by the provider | Only responsible for using the app | Gmail, Dropbox |

🔽 Control decreases from IaaS → PaaS → SaaS  
🔼 Abstraction increases from IaaS → PaaS → SaaS

## ☁️ 4. Cloud Deployment Models

| Deployment Model | Description | Characteristics |
|------------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Cloud** | Fully hosted in the cloud | Built or migrated to the cloud |
| **Hybrid** | Combines on-premises and cloud | Most common model, gradual migration |
| **On-Premises** (Private Cloud) | Resources hosted internally | High control, limited scalability |

## ✅ 5. Benefits of Cloud Computing

- Pay-as-you-go pricing
- Global reach and availability
- Rapid provisioning and deployment
- Elastic scaling (scale up/down on demand)
- Reduced capital expenditures
- Focus on innovation, not maintenance
